During this phase you decide on how the content is to be structured and presented to the users. The approach to this will depend a lot on the type of project, and the designer(s) involved. A process (not *The* process) is given below.

## A process

### The Content

The start of this process relies on the content (text, images, video, etc), or as big a representative sample as possible, being ready. Producing the design based on the actual content will give much better results than using placeholder content. Using placeholder content as a basis for design/development can result in significant revisions being required later in the project.

### Overall structure of application 

This could take the form of a spreadsheet or a flowchart-like diagram. The purpose is to identify all sections (i.e. pages / cards / screens) of the application, and to ensure the flow of navigation through it is consistent and makes sense. It helps answer questions such as "_...so how does a user get to the main help page from here..._"


###Layouts of key pages / templates
   
This step is useful in identifying a user's flow through the application. The output is often a set of ["Wireframe" diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe). 

These help to figure out how various tasks can be accomplished and objectives met in the application. As they are low-fidelity (relatively fast to produce and you won't feel bad throwing them away or writing on them), they are great for quick revisions to explore alternatives and fix problems. 


###Visual Design 

This step answers the question: "What will it actually look like?"
        
The output here could be a static image illustrating a web-page or screen design, a partially-functional web-page template, or take the form of a style-guide which shows representative fonts, colours or imagery to be used in the application.

The output should be "representative", rather than "actual". There are a large number of devices and applications that web-based projects (in particular) can be viewed on - a "mock-up" of a visual design will not capture the minor differences that each display format will introduce.
