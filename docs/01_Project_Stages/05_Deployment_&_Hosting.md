For web-based projects you will need:

## Domain name

This is the website address where your project will be found, for example `http://example.nuigalway.ie` or `www.example.ie`.

There is no annual charge for domain names registered as NUI Galway sub-domains, for example, `something.nuigalway.ie` - the setup is handled internally by ISS. 

For other types of domain names, for example, `.ie`, `.com`, `.org`, etc, there are annual fees. These should be considered as they may have an impact on the long-term availability of the project. For example, if there is no budget to renew the domain name, the site will not be available. If they are being registered, they should be done through ISS.

## Web Hosting

This is where the files that make up your website 'live' on the Internet. It may also include a database, or other type of applications. The type of hosting your application requires will depend on the technologies it uses - your developers will be able to tell you what these requirements are.
