You should remember: _if you build it, they probably won't come_. Considering how to both inform people about the project, and help them find it themselves are important to plan for. In reality, this section should really be called *Marketing*.

Some traffic sources to consider:

###Search Engines 

Search engines (Google in particular) can drive a significant amount of your website traffic. The process of ensuring the site performs well with search engines is called SEO (Search Engine Optimisation).

There are a large number of factors to consider, some of the more important questions to answer are:

- Do all pages have appropriate `<title>` tags in place
- Do all pages have appropriate `meta` descriptions
    - Do all pages have other appropriate `meta` information, such as OpenGraph and/or Dublin Core meta tags, Schema.org markup, etc
- Is the document's mark-up structured correctly? (for example, using a single `<h1></h1>`, other headings/sections structured appropriately, lists marked up appropriately, images have the correct attributes, images are not used for text, etc)
- Can you provide a Sitemap that is readable by search engines? (i.e. in a special XML format)
- Do links in the text explain to the user what they will find when they click through, for example, assume the text inside the [...] is a link:
    - `for more information click [here] <-- (bad)`
    - `read more [about this study's methodology]  <-- (good)`

###Email Marketing
 
Collecting email addresses from interested parties can be a good way of keeping your audience up-to-date with project developments. This can be especially true of research projects where there are often clearly defined, and interested, niche audiences. 

A common way of collecting addresses is to add a mailing list signup form to your project website. When someone completes the form, their email address is sent to your account on an email marketing service, such as [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com) or [Campaign Monitor](http://campaignmonitor.com)

###Social Media

Using social media to connect with your audience can be an important strategy. 

You should be aware that it can often require an investment of time to be useful, and you should plan accordingly. The choice of social media to use will depend strongly on the make-up of your target audience - different audiences can be reached on different platforms.

Some of common platforms to consider using are:

- Facebook
- Twitter
- LinkedIn

## Measurement

Measuring the usage of your application should be an important part of your project. Without some form of measurement, you will have no way of judging whether it is achieving the goals you set out.

Measuring usage throughout the project will help you to identify areas for improvement, for example, testing which pages/sections/buttons are (or are not) being used, and making changes accordingly. The process for this should be: *Measure. Refine. Repeat.*

There are a wide variety of tools available to measure different aspects of your application's performance:

- **"Usage" measurement** - tracking views of pages, traffic sources, etc
    - [Google Analytics](http://google.com/analytics) - widely used, free

    - [CrazyEgg](https://www.crazyegg.com/pricing) - heatmaps of clicks, scrolling, etc - paid
