Along the way, it's often tempting to change decisions / specifications that were made during the planning phase. This can be a result of having arrived a better understanding of the problem during the process of the project development. 

Examples are:

- Deviating from the original specification ("_...can we just add a new..._"). 
- Jumping back a step - for example, once development is complete, deciding you want to re-design a feature ("_...it would be great if that page could also display a..._")

Making changes will generally add time and/or cost to the project. Sometimes it's no problem, sometimes it causes a missed deadline / the developer to quietly weep.

Weighing up the impact of changes to the core specification during development can be difficult - there can be knock-on effects from changing one part of the application. You should consider if it is better to hold major changes for the next version of the application.
