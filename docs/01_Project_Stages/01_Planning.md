##Areas to consider:
  
### Users & Usage

Some of the most important questions to answer are related to the audience for the project. These should guide much of the project's development. 

- Why will the application be used?
- How it will be used?
- Where it will be used? (e.g. level of mobile support, required languages)
- Who will use it? 
    - What level of knowledge do users have? - "expert" users vs general public
    - Who should be allowed to use it? - Security 
    - Who must be able to use it - Accessibility

###A Roadmap 

How do you know when it's finished? The best way is by having a defined spec before you start development. This could map out the complete project, or contain multiple stages for different or evolving versions of the project. 

Before beginning you should also know how you will judge if the project is "successful" - what is the objective, and how will you know if the objective is met? (see the section on measurement in Dissemination & Impact)

You could also consider issues such as:

- Should there be multiple releases? (i.e. Version 1, Version 2)
- Is there a (very) good reason why the data should not be open & re-usable? ...such as through an API

If you are not technical, talk to a developer (and/or designer) as early as you can. It will help:

- avoid potential problems & missed opportunities later on; 
- them to understand the decisions you've made when it comes time for design and development.

###Being selective

An important influence on the decisions you make here is the "story" you are trying to tell with the content. Throwing "everything" at a page isn't going to make it any easier for a user to engage with your content - **be selective**; just because you can give a user an option to change / edit / search everything, doesn't mean you should. Just because you can present everything, it doesn't mean you should.
