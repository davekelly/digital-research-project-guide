There is an assumption here that you are not doing the development, but working with an internal or external developer or team. 

## Selection of appropriate technologies 
  
The best question here is, "what does appropriate mean?". This is something that can only be answered by you in conjunction with your developers. It will likely be a decision based on a mix of:

    Project Requirements - Skills - Knowledge - Budget - Infrastructure - Time

Where possible, you should build on existing frameworks or libraries, rather than developing everything from scratch. Preference should be given to Open Source technologies. These approaches will help reduce development time, and will (hopefully) help to improve the application's longer term maintainability and security.

## Development Tools

Using tools to aid development related tasks can save time and effort. Most will be decided on by the developer, however one in particular is important to be aware of:

- You (and/or your developers) **should be using** some form of [Source Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) to manage the project source code. [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software) is popular and recommended. [GitHub](http://github.com) is a repository where you can store your code; they offer free repositories to Open Source projects, and [discounts to users in education](http://github.com/edu). Another recommended repository service is [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org)
