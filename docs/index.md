<p>
    The purpose of this guide is to give an overview of the process involved in creating a digital project.  The primary target audience are researchers from the Humanities and Social Sciences at <a href="http://nuigalway.ie">NUI Galway</a>.
</p>

<p>
    There is an emphasis on the digital, as opposed to the research, side of the project. There is also a definite slant towards web-based projects, but much of it is relevant to other types of software projects.
